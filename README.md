Reis :rice: provides a Rust version of EI :egg: and EIS :icecream: for emulated input on Wayland.

See the upstream project [libei](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libei) for more information.

This library is currently **incomplete** and subject to change. It should probably do more to provide a more high level API that handles the things a client/server needs to deal with.

Setting the env var `REIS_DEBUG` will make the library print ei messages it sends and receives.
